Components Used:-
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. BreadBoard
3. UltraSonic Sensor(HCSR04)
4. Buzzer
5. LEDs

Description: 

The smart dustbin uses the technology of ultrasonic wave to detect approaching waste and opens the lid automatically. We use ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of the waste and depending on the distance, the lid is opened. 

For this project, the minimum distance for the lid to be opened is 70cm.

Program Code:

#define trigPin 4
#define echoPin 5

const int ledRed = 9;
const int ledGreen = 8;
const int buzzer = A0;

void setup() 
{
 Serial.begin(9600); //start serial monitor and setting baud rate to 9600
 pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); //setting trigger pin to output
 pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); //setting echo pin to input
 pinMode(ledRed, OUTPUT); //setting led red to output
 pinMode(ledGreen, OUTPUT); //setting led green to output
 pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); //setting buzzer to output
}

void loop()
{
  long duration, distance;
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH); //measuring the duration of the pulse received by echoPin
  distance = (duration*0.034)/2; //calculated the distance in cm with speed of sound 
  Serial.print("Distance is: ");
  Serial.println(distance);

  //check if distance is less than 70cm
  if(distance < 70)
  {
    
    digitalWrite(ledGreen, HIGH); //Green LED is turned ON
    digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW); //Red LED is turned OFF
    int buzzVal = 180;
    tone(buzzer, buzzVal, 50); //buzzer is turned ON
    Serial.println("DUSTBIN IS OPEN"); //DustBin is open
  }

  else
  {
    digitalWrite(ledGreen, LOW); //Green LED is turned OFF
    digitalWrite(ledRed, HIGH); //Red LED is turned ON
    analogWrite(buzzer, 0); //Buzzer is turned OFF
    Serial.println("DUSTBIN IS CLOSED"); //DustBin is closed
  }
  delay(200);
}
